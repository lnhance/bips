## Abstract

This BIP describes a new tapscript opcode `OP_PAIRCOMMIT`, which
provides limited vector commitment functionality in tapscript.

## Summary

When verifying taproot script spends having leaf version 0xc0 (as defined in
[BIP-342]), we propose `OP_PAIRCOMMIT` to replace `OP_SUCCESS205` (0xcd).

When evaluated, `OP_PAIRCOMMIT`:
* Pops the top two values off the stack,
* takes the "PairCommit" tagged SHA256 hash of the stack elements with size
commitments,
* pushes the resulting 32-byte hash to the top of stack.

## Specification

The notation below follows that of [BIP-340]. This includes the
$$hash_{tag}(x)$$ notation to refer to
$$SHA256(SHA256(tag) \\| SHA256(tag) \\| x)$$.

* If fewer than 2 elements are on the stack, the script MUST fail and
  terminate immediately.
* The top element ($$x2$$) and second to top element ($$x1$$) are read from the
  stack.
* Let $$pc$$ be $$hash_{PairCommit}(
  compact\\_size(size\\:of\\:x1) \\| x1 \\|
  compact\\_size(size\\:of\\:x2) \\| x2)$$[^1]
* The top two elements are popped from the stack.
* $$pc$$ is pushed to the stack.

[^1]: The number of SHA256 iterations is minimized in the typical use cases.
    Since the Tag can be pre-computed as mid-state, it takes only 2 hash
    cycles for a commitment to 2 32-byte items or 1 for 2 smaller items.

## Motivation

Currently, bitcoin lacks a way to commit to multiple stack elements together.
It is common practice to hash a single item as part of a bitcoin script,
either in hash/time locked contracts, or in pay-to-pubkey-hash (P2PKH)
scripts, but there is no way to commit to multiple items with a single hash. 

In a contrived but demonstrative example, if PAIRCOMMIT existed in legacy
script, P2PKH could be extended to pay-to-pubkey-time-hash with scriptPubKey
`2DUP PAIRCOMMIT RIPEMD160 <hash> EQUALVERIFY CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY DROP
CHECKSIG`. This script format for single signature, time-locked bitcoin could
be transformed into an address format.

With the ability to commit to pairs of elements, PAIRCOMMIT can be generalized
to Merklized commitments to a tree of elements with a single hash. On its own,
this could enable a hash lock contract where the holder of any pre-image in a
Merkle tree can unlock the spend, for example.

If `OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK` is combined with PAIRCOMMIT, the ability to sign
commitments to multiple items enables both of the above but as a form of
delegation. In cases where any single item can be used to unlock an output,
additional off chain signatures be simply can be used as an alternative to
PAIRCOMMIT. However in cases where multiple items must be used for spending
together, PAIRCOMMIT removes the need for costly laddering schemes[^2] to
ensure that all items were authorized together and in order.

[^2]: `OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK` can commit to a sequence of otherwise
    undifferentiated items by requiring a key committed to by the output to
    sign an initial laddering key (`key0`) and then having `key0` sign a tuple
    of `(item1, key1)` and `key1` signing the tuple `(item2, key2)` etc. There
    are some details around ensuring that the items cannot be used as keys
    depending on the requirements of the protocol. This is costly both in
    bytes and sigops and `OP_PAIRCOMMIT` eliminates the need for such
    constructions when committing to any sequence of items.

## Examples

### Committing to more than 2 elements

`OP_PAIRCOMMIT` can be used to commit to a vector of stack elements in a way
that is not vulnerable to various forms of witness malleability. It is, however,
highly optimized for just 2 stack elements.

```text
# pc-hash = PC(a, PC(b, c))

<a> <b> <c> | PC PC <pc-hash> OP_EQUALVERIFY
```

### Use in LN-Symmetry

To do Lightning Symmetry contracts that don't require the nodes to keep old
states and avoid additional signing round trips (and corresponding signature
validations), we need to solve the data availability problem presented by
unilateral closes. Channel peers must be able to reconstruct the script that
spends an intermediate state.

Using in sequence `OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY` (`CTV`), `OP_PAIRCOMMIT` (`PC`),
`OP_INTERNALKEY` (`IK`) and `OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK` (`CSFS`) we can construct a
rebindable channel that is close to [optimal].

The following assembly-like pseudo-code shows a possible Lightning Symmetry
channel construction that ensures sufficient data is available on chain in a
force close to reconstruct the corresponding script and update it with a later
state while only knowing the later state.[^3]

[^3]: Concretely the required data is a full CTV hash of the settlement
    transaction when there are open HTLCs, or merely the difference in balance
    between the channel partners in other cases. Whether the latter
    optimization would be used is an implementation detail not further
    discussed here.

```text
# S = 500000000
# internal key = [BIP-327] aggregate key of channel participants
# channel script:
<sig> <state-n-recovery-data> <state-n-hash> | CTV PC IK CSFS <S+1> CLTV DROP
```

Before funding, sign the first state.

```text
# state-n-hash { nLockTime(S+n), out(contract, amount(A)+amount(B)) }
# settlement-n-hash { nSequence(2w), out(A, amount(A)), out(B, amount(B)) }
# state-n-recovery-data { settlement-n-hash or state-n-balance }
# update script:
IF
  <sig> <state-m-recovery-data> <state-m-hash> | CTV PC IK CSFS <S+n+1> CLTV DROP
ELSE
  <settlement-n-hash> CTV
ENDIF
```

### In [MATT]

The Merkelize All The Things (MATT) framework proposes to use `OP_CAT` to
combine multiple items into a single commitment for use with
`OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY`. `OP_PAIRCOMMIT` provides a more ergonomic way to
accomplish this[^4].

[^4]: `OP_CAT` can be used to commit to multiple items, but it is subject to
    byte shifting attacks if used naively.
    E.g. `0x0102 || 0x03` equals `0x01 || 0x0203`. Mitigating this correctly
    requires either length checking or hashing, or both.

## Alternative approaches

The following list of alternative approaches were discussed and rejected for
various reasons, either for expanding the scope or for unnecessary complexity:

* `OP_CAT`[^4][^7]
* SHA256 streaming opcodes[^7]
* Merkle operation opcodes
* 'Kitty' CAT: `OP_CAT` with result or inputs arbitrarily limited in size
* `OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY` committing to the taproot annex in tapscript[^5]
* `OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK` on n elements as message
* `OP_VECTORCOMMIT`: generalized form for n > 2 elements
* ReKey/Laddering[^2]
* `OP_RETURN`[^6]

[^5]: As seen in Greg Sanders' [Lightning Symmetry write-up], one additional
    item can be committed to by a transaction signature by placing that item
    in the Taproot annex. This mechanism is limited to a single additional
    item and that item is not made accessible to script making it less useful.
[^6]: `OP_RETURN` can also be used to cause a transaction signature or CTV
    hash to commit to additional data items. This is both costly for the user,
    as this inexpensive to validate data is pushed into transaction data
    instead of witness data and not accessible to script making it less useful
    like the annex.
[^7]: `OP_PAIRCOMMIT` is intended to enable more useful bitcoin scripts, in
    some cases similar to those enabled by `OP_CAT` but without also enabling
    unexpected script behaviors such as those described by Andrew Poelstra in 
    [CAT-tricks-I] and [CAT-tricks-II] or larger numeric operations.

## Reference Implementation

### Code

```c++
case OP_PAIRCOMMIT: {
    // OP_PAIRCOMMIT is only available in Tapscript
    // ...
    // x1 x2 -- hash
    if (stack.size() < 2) {
        return set_error(serror, SCRIPT_ERR_INVALID_STACK_OPERATION);
    }
    const valtype& vch1 = stacktop(-2);
    const valtype& vch2 = stacktop(-1);

    uint256 hash = PairCommitHash(vch1, vch2);

    stack.pop_back();
    stack.pop_back();
    stack.emplace_back(hash.begin(), hash.end());
    break;
}
```
```c++
const HashWriter HASHER_PAIRCOMMIT{TaggedHash("PairCommit")};

uint256 PairCommitHash(const std::vector<unsigned char>& x1, const std::vector<unsigned char>& x2)
{
    return (HashWriter{HASHER_PAIRCOMMIT} << x1 << x2).GetSHA256();
}
```

## Rationale

### Cost comparison of LN-Symmetry constructions

The following table briefly summarizes the costs associated with force closing
Lightning Symmetry channels enabled by various combinations of proposed script
upgrades.

| Method           | ChannelSc | UpdateSc | UpdateW | ForceC  | Contest | Settle |
| :--------------- | --------: | -------: | ------: | ------: | ------: | :----: |
| APO-Annex        |      8 WU |   113 WU |  100 WU | 1221 WU |  627 WU | SigOp  |
| APO-Return       |      8 WU |   113 WU |   66 WU | 1359 WU |  765 WU | SigOp  |
| CTV+CSFS+IKEY    |     10 WU |    48 WU |   98 WU | 1328 WU |  732 WU |  CTV   |
| CTV+CSFS         |     43 WU |    81 WU |   98 WU | 1394 WU |  765 WU |  CTV   |
| CTV+CSFS+IKEY+PC |     11 WU |    49 WU |  131 WU | 1191 WU |  594 WU |  CTV   |

*ChannelSc: channel script, UpdateSc: update script, UpdateW: witness is the
same size for both Force Close and Contest in LN-Symmetry, ForceC: total cost
of unilateral close transactions, Contest: The additional cost to contest a
force closure, Settle: Whether a signature operation or CTV operation is
required to validate the settlement transaction*

### Proving general computation using trees

Any script change which enables commitment to pairs of items necessarily
enables commitments to Merkle trees.

Merkle trees can be used to prove computation where the root of the tree
represents the *function* and the leaves represent the *inputs* and *output*.
There are practical limits to the entropy space for the *inputs* as they need
to be iterated over and hashed into a Merkle root.

Taproot trees can already cover 128 bits of entropy space, which is over the
practical limits to iterate over and merkelize. Therefore, we conclude that
enabling Merkle commitments in script does not materially extend what
computations are possible to prove in bitcoin script. While `OP_PAIRCOMMIT` is
not limited to a height of 128, greater heights are not practically
computable.

## Backward Compatibility

By constraining the behavior of OP_SUCCESS opcodes, deployment of the BIP
can be done in a backwards-compatible, soft-fork manner. If anyone were to
rely on the OP_SUCCESS behavior of `OP_SUCCESS205`, `OP_PAIRCOMMIT` would
invalidate their spend.

## Deployment
